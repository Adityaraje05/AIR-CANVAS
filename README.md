Air Canvas is an innovative project that allows users to draw or interact with a virtual canvas using hand gestures detected by a camera. This project leverages computer vision techniques to create a seamless and interactive drawing experience, enabling users to "paint" in the air without physical tools.

Key Features
1. Hand Gesture Recognition :
   - Detects hand movements using a webcam or an external camera.
   - Identifies fingertips for precise drawing control.

2. Virtual Drawing :
   - Allows users to create sketches or designs by moving their hand in the air.
   - Real-time updates on the canvas, mimicking traditional drawing.

3. Multiple Colors and Thickness Options :
   - Users can switch between colors or change the line thickness via gestures or keyboard inputs.

Technologies Used

1. Programming Language :
   - Python
     
2. Libraries:
   - OpenCV (for real-time hand tracking and gesture detection)
   - NumPy (for processing image data)
   - Mediapipe (for advanced hand tracking and pose estimation)

3. Hardware:
   - Any webcam or compatible external camera.


How It Works
1. Hand Detection :
   - Uses Mediapipe to detect the hand landmarks (like fingertips, palm, etc.).
   - Tracks the movement of the fingertips to draw on the canvas.

2. Virtual Canvas :
   - The detected hand movements are translated into lines and shapes on a blank virtual canvas.

3. Gesture-Based Commands :
   - Specific gestures can be programmed to switch colors, change pen size, or clear the canvas.
